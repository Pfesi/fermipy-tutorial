# Python and Linux preparation

This hands-on activity will make considerable use of Python, Jupyter Notebook and Linux. If you are not familiar with the Python programming language, Jupyter or Linux, we recommend that you study them *before* the hands-on session. 

Some suggested  preparatory material on the basics of Python as a scientific computing language or Linux: 

- [Lectures on scientific computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures)
- [UNIX tutorial for beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
- [Getting started with Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)


# Requirements

To participate in the tutorial we recommend that you bring your laptop. The minimum hardware requirements for are: 

- at least 4GB of RAM 
- ~10 GB of free disk space

We recommend Linux or MacOS. This tutorial was not tested on a windows machine, so we cannot guarantee it will work on windows.

# Installation instructions

In order to proceed with the lesson, you will need a working installation of several packages. Fortunately, all the analysis software and data files required for the lesson are conveniently pre-installed in a ready-to-use, self-contained Docker image (see [step 1](#1-install-docker) below). The Docker image should run on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

The software already contained in the Docker image are:

- [Fermi Science Tools](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/)
- [`Fermipy`](https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package 

We recommend that you start downloading early the files, given their large file size. *Please do not download large files during the tutorial or the WIFI network will overload*. 

## 1. Install Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a convenient virtual machine environment which has been getting very popular lately because it allows developers to ship images conveniently with pre-installed software. If you are interested, browse the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) to learn what kind of Docker images are available. Thanks to Docker, we will not need to worry about installing the Linux environment and Fermi ScienceTools for our lessonâ€”there is an image pre-built with everything we need! 

To get started you should first [install Docker Desktop if using Windows or MacOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Docker Engine Community](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) if using Linux. 

Once Docker is installed in your laptop, you should...

## 2. Get the `Fermipy` Docker image

Open a terminal and issue the command

    sudo docker pull fermipy/fermipy:11-05-02

This should take a while because >2GB of software will be downloaded and installed.

> Linux pro tip: if you add your user to the `docker` group, you do not need to use `sudo` to run Docker . The command to perform this task on linux is `sudo usermod -a -G docker yourusername` (you only need to run it once)

## 3. Download the supporting files for the lesson

You will need `wget` installed in order to proceed. Issue the following commands in the terminal to download all supporting data files for the lesson:

    wget -O install.sh https://gist.github.com/rsnemmen/f97823e466583d7d1101b5dd579cda8c/raw
    sh install.sh

After the command is done, you should have all files which are necessary for the lesson available locally in your machine.

## 4. Test the installation by launching a Docker container instance

i. Open Docker. 

- Linux: the Docker service should already be running in the background, so no action required.
- Mac/Windows: Look for the Docker icon in your computer and click on it to open the application. ![](https://www.brianweet.com/assets/docker-blog-1/docker-logo.png "Docker icon")

ii. `cd fermi` to the directory which contains the lesson files and where we plan to run our analysis. 

iii. Launch a docker container instance.

Run the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy:11-05-02
```

This will start a Jupyter notebook server that will be attached to port 8888. The `-v $PWD:/workdir` argument mounts the current directory to the working area of the container. Once you start the server it will print a URL similar to the following one:

```
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=8e09274cb649d659abce695ab6481242670d9edbcf24f095
```

iv. Copy and paste the http address printed in the above step in your web browser (your address will be different):

```     
http://localhost:8888/?token=8e09274cb649d659abce695ab6481242670d9edbcf24f095
```

Your browser should now display something similar to this: ![](./Screenshot-jupyter.png "Web browser after successful launching of Jupyter Notebook from Docker instance")

Note that the same docker image may be used to launch python, ipython, or a bash shell by passing the command as an argument to docker run:

```
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy ipython
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy python
sudo docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy /bin/bash
```

- - - 

If you interrupt the activity and want to resume it later, just make sure to launch the Docker container instance inside the `fermi` directory. All your progress will be saved there.

Now you can proceed with the lesson.
