# Python and Linux preparation

This hands-on activity will make considerable use of Python, Jupyter Notebook and Linux. If you are not familiar with the Python programming language, Jupyter or Linux, we recommend that you study them *before* the hands-on session. 

Some suggested  preparatory material on the basics of Python as a scientific computing language or Linux: 

- [Lectures on scientific computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures)
- [UNIX tutorial for beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
- [Getting started with Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)


# Hardware requirements

To participate in the tutorial we recommend that you bring your laptop. The minimum hardware requirements for are: 

- at least 4GB of RAM 
- ~10 GB of free disk space

# Installation instructions

In order to proceed with the lesson, you will need a working installation of:

- [Fermi Science Tools](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/)
- [`Fermipy`](https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python package 
- Lesson supporting files: Jupyter notebook and observations 

Fortunately, all the analysis software and data files required for the lesson are conveniently pre-installed in a ready-to-use, self-contained Docker image. The Docker image should run on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

We recommend that you start downloading early the files, given their large file size. *Please do not download large files during the tutorial or the WIFI network will overload*. 

## 1. Install Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a convenient virtual machine environment which has been getting very popular lately because it allows developers to ship images conveniently with pre-installed software. If you are interested, browse the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) to learn what kind of Docker images are available. Thanks to Docker, we will not need to worry about installing the Linux environment and Fermi ScienceTools for our lessonâ€”there is an image pre-built with everything we need! 

To get started you should first [install the Community Edition of Docker by following these instructions](https://www.docker.com/community-edition). 

Once Docker is installed in your laptop, you should...

## 2. Get the `Fermipy` Docker image

Open a terminal and issue the command

    docker pull fermipy/fermipy

This should take a while because >2GB of software will be downloaded and installed.

## 3. Download the supporting files for the lesson

i. Create a new directory somewhere in your machine, let's say `fermi`:  

```  
mkdir fermi
cd fermi
```

ii. Clone the repository with the lesson notebook.

```
git clone https://github.com/black-hole-group/fermipy-tutorial.git
``` 

You should now have a new directory called `fermi/fermipy-tutorial`.

iii. Download the data files with observations.

Issue the following commands to download the file `fermi-data.tar.bz2` and unpack it. This file contains all the observations (828 MB).

```
mkdir ./fermipy-tutorial/data
wget -O ./fermipy-tutorial/data/fermi-data.tar.bz2 https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6qbj7es0v9djv5/fermi-data.tar.bz2?dl=0
tar -xvjf ./fermipy-tutorial/data/fermi-data.tar.bz2 -C ./fermipy-tutorial/data
```

If the download gets interrupted, you can resume the download from where it stopped:

    wget -c -O ./fermipy-tutorial/data/fermi-data.tar.bz2 https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6qbj7es0v9djv5/fermi-data.tar.bz2?dl=0

iv. (_optional_) Check file integrity.

If you want to check the file integrity, you can use the command

    md5sum fermipy-tutorial/data/fermi-data.tar.bz2

(replace `md5sum` with `md5` if using a Mac). This command will spit a string. The string should match this one:  149b2e7d499a78f18bec22ad40fd3d98. If they are different, your file was corrupted during the download and you need to restart the download.

## 4. Launch a Docker container instance

i. Launch Docker in your computer. 

- Mac/Windows: Look for the Docker icon in your computer and click on it to open the application. ![](https://www.brianweet.com/assets/docker-blog-1/docker-logo.png "Docker icon")
- Linux: the Docker service should already be running in the background, so no action required.

ii. `cd` to the `fermi` directory which contains the lesson files and where we plan to run our analysis. 
iii. Launch a docker container instance.

Run the following command in a new terminal:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy
```

This will start a Jupyter notebook server that will be attached to port 8888. The `-v $PWD:/workdir` argument mounts the current directory to the working area of the container. Once you start the server it will print a URL similar to the following one:

```
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://721f57bdddfd:8888/?token=36376320b1d20c0937deaf606d6a8134be8c54d3cf0fa5f5&token=36376320b1d20c0937deaf606d6a8134be8c54d3cf0fa5f5
```

iv. Copy and paste the address above in your web browser, and replace the string between `http://` and `:8888` with `localhost`; in our case, we would use the following address in our browser (your address will be different):

```     
http://localhost:8888/?token=36376320b1d20c0937deaf606d6a8134be8c54d3cf0fa5f5&token=36376320b1d20c0937deaf606d6a8134be8c54d3cf0fa5f5
```

Your browser should now display something similar to this: ![](./Screenshot-jupyter.png "Web browser after successful launching of Jupyter Notebook from Docker instance")

Note that the same docker image may be used to launch python, ipython, or a bash shell by passing the command as an argument to docker run:

```
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy ipython
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy python
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workdir -w /workdir fermipy/fermipy /bin/bash
```

- - - 

If you interrupt the activity and want to resume it later, just make sure to launch the Docker container instance inside the `fermi` directory. All your progress will be saved there.

Now you can proceed with the lesson and move on to the [overview of activities](https://speakerdeck.com/rsnemmen/analysis-of-fermi-lat-data-hands-on-day-1).
