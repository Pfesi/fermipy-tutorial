Fermi LAT data analysis: Hands on session
==============================================

**⚠️Please [download the files](./pre-requisites.md) before the tutorial**  
We ask the participants of the school to download all required files for this lesson *beforehand*. The required files involve >2GB of downloads. This will overload the wifi network at the school if everybody downloads at the same time.   
*You will not be able to follow the activity without downloading the files*

# Introduction

Welcome to the *Fermi* LAT hands-on tutorial on the analysis of gamma-ray observations. Here, we will learn how to analyze gamma-ray observations for the following targets:

1. **Dark matter:** we will analyze the photons coming from the direction of a dwarf galaxy, do a simple estimate of the dark matter cross section and reproduce the analysis described in [Ackermann et al. (2015)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.231301). 
2. **Blazar:** we will analyze photons emitted by the blazar TXS 0506+056—the first astrophysical source from which [a gamma-ray flare was detected coinciding with a high-energy neutrino](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/eaat1378?_ga=2.130451464.622421256.1563993155-1416707261.1563993155). We will create an SED and a light curve for this source in the period close to the neutrino detection. We will reproduce some of the analysis described in [The IceCube Colabortion et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08816.pdf). 

This activity has a total duration of about 4 hours and is organized as follows:

1. [Download and install](./pre-requisites.md) required software and data files *before the lesson starts*
2. Overview of *Fermi* Gamma-ray Telescope ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rsnemmen/overview-of-fermi-gamma-ray-telescope))
3. Hands-on activity 1: Estimating dark matter cross section from Fermi LAT observations
4. Hands-on activity 2: The gamma-ray spectrum and light curve of a blazar
