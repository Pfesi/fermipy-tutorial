Fermi LAT data analysis: Hands on session
==============================================

**⚠️Please [download the files](./pre-requisites.md) before the tutorial**  
We ask the participants of the school to download all required files for this lesson *beforehand*. The required files involve >2GB of downloads. This will overload the wifi network at the school if everybody downloads at the same time.   
*You will not be able to follow the activity without downloading the files*

# Introduction

Welcome to the *Fermi* LAT hands-on tutorial on the analysis of gamma-ray observations. This activity has a total duration of 4 hours. The emphasis here is on getting the students started on the analysis of *Fermi* LAT observations as soon as possible, such that you will be able to perform analysis by yourself in the future if you wish so. 

The organization of this activity is the following:

1. [Download and install](./pre-requisites.md) required software and data files *before the lesson*
2. Introduction, overview of activities (slides) TBD
3. Estimating dark matter cross section from Fermi LAT observations.
