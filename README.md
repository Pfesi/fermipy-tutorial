Fermi LAT data analysis: Hands on session
==============================================

**⚠️Please [download the files](./pre-requisites.md) before the tutorial**  
We ask the participants of the school to download all required files for this lesson *beforehand*. The required files involve >2GB of downloads. This will overload the wifi network at the school if everybody downloads at the same time.   
*You will not be able to follow the activity without downloading the files*

# Introduction

Welcome to the *Fermi* LAT hands-on tutorial on the analysis of gamma-ray observations. Here, we will learn how to analyze gamma-ray data for a dwarf galaxy, do a simple estimate of the dark matter cross section and reproduce the analysis described in [Ackermann et al. (2015)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.231301). 

This activity has a total duration of about 4 hours and is organized as follows:

1. [Download and install](./pre-requisites.md) required software and data files *before the lesson*
2. Overview of Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rsnemmen/overview-of-fermi-gamma-ray-telescope))
3. Hands-on activity: Estimating dark matter cross section from Fermi LAT observations
